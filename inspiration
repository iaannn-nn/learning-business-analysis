@all

These are 2 of the most useful podcast episodes I listened to:

1) https://linearb.io/dev-interrupted/podcast/how-to-leverage-a-non-technical-background-in-eng

2) https://linearb.io/dev-interrupted/podcast/preparing-for-your-first-vp-of-engineering-role

They are more for Senior/Leader positions, 
but they can be a good mindset and practical training for anyone in the company.

If you listen to them, let me know what you think ðŸ˜‰
